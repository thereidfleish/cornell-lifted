          <div>
            <b>Version 4.0 (8/23/25)</b>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>We've migrated the web app from pure Flask/Jinja2 to Next.js/React frontend and Flask backend!  This improves the overall user experience and maintainability of the web app.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <b>Version 3.2.3 (6/4/25)</b>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>Want to see some fun stats about Lifted?  Well, now you can!  We've added a Lifted Popped tab!</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <b>Version 3.2.2 (5/7/25)</b>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>To make it easier for us on the backend, we've added a hidden card override option to the Admin Dashboard.  Now, if you request access to your Lifted cards that you forgot to pick up three years ago, we can reveal them on your Messages page in one click, rather than digging through our archives!</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <b>Version 3.2.1 (5/3/25)</b>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>Card PDF caching for quicker retrievals of card PDFs.  What does this mean?  Well, we no longer have to generate a PDF of your card from scratch every time you want to download it.  Instead, we do this once, and you can download it once, twice, or a thousand times more without any delay!</li>
              <li>Minor bug fixes and improvements</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

              <li>We've added support for different card templates per card attachment (both on single and bulk message PPTX/PDF export).  This means we can now customize the appearance of each card depending on what attachment you chose!</li>
              <li>Now you can see which attachment your recipient selected (if any) by clicking on your sent messages.  Happy snooping!</li>
